After you add the snapshot to a story slide, you will be able to animate the list by clicking on the text placeholders. The mouse pointer will change from arrow to hand when you hover over the text placeholder.
After its properties have been set, size and color, and it has been snapshotted, the extension can be deleted from the sheet and used in a story slide as a snapshot object.
