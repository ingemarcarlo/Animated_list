Animated bulleted list extension for Data Storytelling

This extension was designed for use with Data Storytelling. After you add the extension to a sheet you can set the dimension from which the rows of text come from, the size and color of the text. This extension shows how to use the simple color-picker. After you add the snapshot to a story slide, you will be able to animate the list by clicking on the text placeholders. The mouse pointer will change from arrow to hand when you hover over the text placeholder.
After its properties have been set, size and color, and it has been snapshotted, the extension can be deleted from the sheet and used in a story slide as a snapshot object.

This extensions has been tested with Qlik Sense desktop version 1.1
